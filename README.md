# The-What

A new text adventure game based on childhood memories of my sister and I playing together during the summer. 
Our mom worked for the athletic department of a big state university and my sister and I would often
badger the football players to play with us. One, a superstar running back named Moe, was kind enough to give us attention.

Moe told us of a shadowy figure called The What. Only kids could see The What. So we, like he was as a child, were now tasked with
hunting The What. And that's how we spent several mid-90s summers.

My sister was born with chronic disease and spent many days, and sometimes weeks, at a time in the hospital.
I always wished I could cure her...protect her...save her. 

So this story (which will contiue to grow as I develop this game) is very personal to me. 
It is a metaphor, sure. But it's a story I've been trying to figure out how to tell for decades now.

This is THE WHAT.
